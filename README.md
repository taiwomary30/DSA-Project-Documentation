This is where I started my portfolio building while taking my Data Analysis class with the Incubator Hub.

## Project Topic: E Commerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overview

By analysing the various parameters in the data received we seek to gather enough inisight to make reasonable decisions which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from insight gotten and to know the best performance from our data.
